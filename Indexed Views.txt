Materialized Views?
- SQL Server has not

In SQL Server, 
the concept of Materialized Views as 
implemented in some other database systems 
(like Oracle or PostgreSQL) does not exist natively. 

However, similar functionality can be achieved 
using Indexed Views or 
by creating Custom Processes that 
periodically refresh a View 
to make it behave similarly to 
a materialized view.

1. Indexed Views in SQL Server:

SQL Server allows you to create indexed views, 
which can persist the result set of 
a query in the database. 

When an index is created on a view, 
SQL Server stores the result of 
that view physically, 
which makes it similar to 
a materialized view. 

The indexed views have 
specific requirements and limitations.

Key Characteristics of 
Indexed Views:

- The result of the view is 
stored physically in the database.

- Indexes can be created on the view, 
which optimizes access to the data.

- The view is automatically updated when 
underlying data is modified 
	(insert, update, delete).

- There are restrictions on 
the kinds of queries 
that can be used in an indexed view 
(e.g., no DISTINCT, GROUP BY, etc.).

Steps 
to create 
an Indexed View:

1. Create a view: 
The first step is to create the view, 
but it must meet certain requirements, 
such as containing deterministic expressions,  
no outer joins, and no aggregations 
unless they are valid under 
the indexed view restrictions.

Example:
CREATE VIEW dbo.MyIndexedView
WITH SCHEMABINDING
AS
SELECT Column1, Column2, SUM(Column3) AS TotalColumn
FROM dbo.MyTable
GROUP BY Column1, Column2;

2. Create an index on the view: 
After creating the view, 
you can create a Unique Clustered Index, 
which physically materializes the data.

Example:

CREATE UNIQUE CLUSTERED INDEX IDX_MyIndexedView ON dbo.MyIndexedView (Column1, Column2);

Once the index is created, 
the view is stored on disk and 
the data is materialized, 
meaning the query can be run 
much faster because it doesn't need to be 
recalculated every time it is queried.

2. Alternative Approach  

- Scheduled Materialization 
with a Job:

Another approach is 
to simulate materialized views by 
using scheduled jobs (via SQL Server Agent) 
that periodically refresh 
a regular view or 
table with the latest data.

Steps to 
simulate materialized views:

1. Create a table to store the materialized data.

CREATE TABLE dbo.MaterializedTable (
    Column1 INT,
    Column2 INT,
    TotalColumn INT
);

2. Create a job 
that runs a stored procedure 
to refresh the data periodically. 
This procedure would insert or update 
the data in the table with the results of the query.

Example stored procedure:

CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.RefreshMaterializedTable
AS
BEGIN
    TRUNCATE TABLE dbo.MaterializedTable;
    INSERT INTO dbo.MaterializedTable (Column1, Column2, TotalColumn)
    SELECT Column1, Column2, SUM(Column3)
    FROM dbo.MyTable
    GROUP BY Column1, Column2;
END;

3. Schedule the job 
to run at regular intervals (e.g., every hour) 
to refresh the materialized data.
